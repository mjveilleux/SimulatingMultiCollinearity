# SimulatingMultiCollinearity

How to interpret your regression model in the face of increasing multi-collinearity?

The Gauss-Markov assumption of no perfect multi-collinearity is not well defined and typically stumps beginners.

I show just how increasing the correlation between two explanatory variables can skew your coefficients (beta hats) and predictions ( y hat)

This gives an intuitive guide for understanding this type of correlation in our regression models. It is also a great example of why to never trust your 
R^2 in multivariate regression.
